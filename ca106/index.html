          <p>
            This website is part of my CA103 Portfolio. I created this website using my knowledge of the Gestalt Principles
            and other methods I have learned over the course of this module. I had a little bit of previous knowledge with creating a website as
            part of my Leaving Cert 2021 project.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Jack Egan, I am currently 18 years old and I am a computer science student and 
            I am currently studying at Dublin City University in my first year. I am from a town called Swords in the North of Dublin.

          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
            I did my leaving cert last year, I did computer science for Leaving Cert and I achieved a H2 which has helped me with many things so far this year.
            We used a little bit of CSS, HTML and a little bit of JavaScript when I did work last year.

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <h3>AIB:</h3>
                <p> I worked at AIB in Leopardstown during Transition Year.<br>
                  This work experience was heavily tech based.<br>
                  This got me really interested in Cyber Security.
                </p>
                <h3>AppleGreen:</h3>
                <p> I worked in Applegreen Kinsealy for the entire Summer 2021.<br>
                  This helped me improve my communication and teamwork skills.<br>
                  I made many friends and this helped me save up my money over the Summer.
                </p>
                <h3>SwordsEvents:</h3>
                <p> This was my first job, I got it when I was sixteen years old.<br>
                  My task was primarily as Event staff and security.<br>
                  I worked on different events such as Christmas market and Summer Events.

                <h2>Fashion</h2>
                <p>Fashion is something that interests me a lot, especially streetwear or urban fashion as this impacts me directly.
                  I like to wear a lot of hoodies or sweatshirts, cargo bottoms, air forces and often I like to add accessories to my outfits.
                  There are many brands that I wish I had more articles of clothing from but fashion can be very expensive at times.

                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>Food is another one of my favourite things. I love to try many different types of food and especially
                  when trying food from different cultures. 
                  Some of my favourite foods are chinese food and middle eastern food.

                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <p>I have travelled to many different countries in my Life. Last year I went on my first holidays without my parents
                  to Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was very warm over there as it was the middle of Summer. This year I plan to take a trip
                  to the Middle East or to North America.
